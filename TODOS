- add duty cycle to wave generation and modularize it to work on any wave
- same thing with reversing the wave form
- try making random wave forms with various parameters
    - try brownian noise (self similar)
    - try different distributions of noise
    - try holding same rand val for a few cycles

- get a table of piano notes and add support for playing via the keyboard

- add a fourier transform and some visualization for analysis

- get better performance to stop clicking:
    - separate key handling into a second thread and have the audio thread read from
      a data structure of currently active CacheReaders
      - data structure can just be a type with an array of cache readers and a size
      - to make it thread-safe both the audio thread and the input thread CAS the pointer to the structure before reading/updating

- after improving input performance, add keyboard mode


- add key lookup table to map [0-87] -> note
