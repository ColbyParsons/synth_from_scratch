- add duty cycle to wave generation and modularize it to work on any wave
- same thing with reversing the wave form
- try making random wave forms with various parameters
    - try brownian noise (self similar)
    - try different distributions of noise
    - try holding same rand val for a few cycles

- get a table of piano notes and add support for playing via the keyboard

- add a fourier transform and some visualization for analysis

- get better performance to stop clicking:
    - idea: when an waveform is used at a given frequency, precompute the waveform into an array
      for the current sample rate and then just memcpy it multiple times
    - alternatively if known ahead of time, we can build a cache of waveform sample arrays for all normal piano notes


- add key lookup table to map [0-87] -> note
